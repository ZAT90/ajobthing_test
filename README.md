**Question 1:**

What kind of architecture did you use?

```
MVC+S
```
**Question 2:**

What libraries did you add to the app? What are they used for? if you not rely the other library tell us why?

```
connectivity_plus - for checking internet connection status
flutter_bloc - uses bloc architecture to seperate business logics from UI
dio - http client for api calls 
logger - for logging and debugging. flutter recommends this rather than using print statement
intl - used for date formatting
url_launcher - for launching urls and launching services such as email, whatsapp 
```
**Question 3:**

How long did you spend on the test?

```
13 hours
```
**Question 4:**

If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

```
A toggle option to filter out either candidates or blogs

```
**Question 5:**

Which parts of your submission are you most proud of? And why? little advice, dont answer whole project, use one what you think it special.What kind of architecture did you use?

```
The search feature using a complete bloc architecture dependent solution.
```
**Question 6:**

Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

```
Mix up two different types of list was the most difficult. spent most of the time to show the mixed up list together and filtering the search results based on user input
```
**Question 7:**

How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them, please elaborate more about this.

```
It touched most of the common practices in flutter that should be in a test. It was straight forward with some basic challenges. In case of improvements, maybe the email, address and candidate status email could just be an api that gives details based on candidate id. Otherwise, each api call has to load a whole list of data. It will be time consuming when the list has more than 20 or 30 data.
```
**Question 8:**

The last question, quality or quantity?

```
Quality, quality and quality. It is the most important thing to survive in the long run.
```
